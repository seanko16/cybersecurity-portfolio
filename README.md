# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Sean Kopenkov

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.  
I’m a junior cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in network security, cloud security, and SOC operations. This GitHub documents my learning journey, projects, and labs across areas like GCP, SIEM, firewalls, and secure coding.

I **began documenting my work on GitHub midway through my courses**.  
Earlier projects are not included here, but from this point forward I’ve **committed to sharing selected labs, notes, and exercises consistently**.

## 📂 Structure
- **SOC-Notes/** → SIEM queries, investigation steps, incident handling notes.
- **TryHackMe/** → Daily lab write-ups & summaries.
- **Cloud-Security/** → Google Cloud security labs, IAM, and detection projects.
→ Projects and labs from Course 3, modules 2 onward.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong foundation as a SOC Analyst (Tier 1 → Tier 2).
- Develop cloud security skills - By finishing the GCP cybersecurity Course.
- Explore the project theme.

## 📌 Current Focus
- Completing TryHackMe **Pentest Path** (1 lab per day).
- Building detection playbooks for common attack techniques.
- Documenting GCP security projects and Modules.

⭐ Stay tuned — I’ll be updating this repo weekly with new labs and notes.
