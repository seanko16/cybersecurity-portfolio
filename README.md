# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Sean Kopenkov

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.  
This repo documents my learning journey and projects in **SOC analysis, cloud security, and pentesting**.

## 📂 Structure
- **SOC-Notes/** → SIEM queries, investigation steps, incident handling notes.
- **TryHackMe/** → Daily lab write-ups & summaries.
- **Cloud-Security/** → Google Cloud security labs, IAM, and detection projects.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong foundation as a SOC Analyst (Tier 1 → Tier 2).
- Develop cloud security skills (Google Cloud focus).
- Explore pentesting as a secondary interest.

## 📌 Current Focus
- Completing TryHackMe **SOC Analyst Path** (1 lab per day).
- Building detection playbooks for common attack techniques.
- Documenting GCP security projects.

⭐ Stay tuned — I’ll be updating this repo weekly with new labs and notes.
