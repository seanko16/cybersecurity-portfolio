# üß© TryHackMe ‚Äî File & Hash Threat Intelligence

## üìö What Have I Learned
- so far, in the room I have touched about the types of file paths that indicate a suspicious file path.
- and I learned about heuristic filename indicators, such as:

- Double Extensions -> invoice.pdf.exe
why is it a problem? -> because by default windows hides the file extensions. which makes the victim believe the file is not malicious.
how do we prevent it? -> by disabling the feature to hide extensions of the file explorer.

- System Binary Impersonatation -> svchost.exe
why is it a problem? -> because we may think its a legitimate process running on our system while it's actually a trojan.
how do we prevent it? ->  by not relaying on the filename but on the file path and creating an allowlist for legit paths of specific filenames using: Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)

- High-entropy Strings -> jnkaf77t1.exe
why is it a problem? -> it's usually a random generated filename created by the attacker to avoid/bypass the "sign" it has by Antivirus software.
how do we prevent it? -> Being cautious of suspicious filenames, and provide employees with regular phishing awareness training and guidance on recognizing suspicious files

- Masquerading -> backup-2300.exe
why is it a problem? -> Users may believe it's a legitimate file because of it not suspicious name.
how do we prevent it? -> Look for filenames that are not supposed to be executed from their location such as: TEMP folders. Or check the Parent process of created files in the system.
And include this in the employees phishing awareness training.

additionally I have learned how to check for the file hases using powershell/cmd/linux.
powershell: get-filehash -literalpath "<file_path\filename.ext>" -Algorithm SHA256
cmd: certutil -hashfile "<filename.ext>" SHA256
linux: sha256sum "<file_path\filename.ext>"
Store the hashes in lowercase to avoid needless differences.
Hash what matters in your investigation. For example, if the malware lives inside a zip file, hash both the archive and the extracted binary.
i learned about another tool similiar to virustotal named malwarebazzar, its complex syntax and its dashboard showcase.
I have learned that I might want to correlate between a couple sources and not just one like virustotal. - something I have acknowledged in the room prior.
also i have learned that virustotal can correlate known malware with specific MITRE techniques which I can use to forward my report better.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Practiced


## ‚úîÔ∏è Takeaway 
I understand the better way of assesing IOC's. I now know how to act upon incidents/events that require more investigations.
I am excited to continue to the other rooms related to CTI.
