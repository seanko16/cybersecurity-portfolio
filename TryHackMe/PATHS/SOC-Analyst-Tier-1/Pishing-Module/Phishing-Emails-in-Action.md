# Phishing Email Analysis: Key Techniques from TryHackMe

## Introduction

This document summarizes the key takeaways and phishing techniques observed in the ["Phishing Emails in Action"](https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemailsinaction) room on TryHackMe. The purpose of this analysis is to deconstruct real-world phishing emails to better understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors. This serves as a personal reference and learning repository for identifying and mitigating phishing threats.

## Analysis of Phishing Techniques

Phishing attacks are rarely one-dimensional. Attackers layer multiple techniques to create a convincing and effective lure. The following is a breakdown of the common techniques identified in the room.

### ### Urgency and Fear Tactics

* **What it is:** This technique involves creating a false sense of urgency or fear to pressure the recipient into acting quickly without thinking critically. The email subject lines often include phrases like "Your account has been suspended," "Immediate action required," or "Unusual sign-in activity."
* **Analysis:** By manufacturing a crisis, attackers exploit human psychology. The fear of financial loss or a security breach can cause a user to bypass standard security protocols and click a malicious link or open a dangerous attachment impulsively. This is one of the most powerful social engineering tools in a phisher's arsenal.

### ### Spoofed Email Address

* **What it is:** Attackers forge the sender's email address (the `From` field) to make it appear as if the email originated from a legitimate and trusted source, such as a bank, a well-known company (e.g., PayPal, DHL), or even a colleague.
* **Analysis:** This is a foundational technique designed to establish initial trust. If a user sees a familiar sender name or email, they are significantly more likely to engage with the email's content. While examining the email headers can often reveal the true origin, most users don't perform this check, making spoofing highly effective.

### ### Link Manipulation

* **What it is:** This involves embedding hyperlinks where the displayed text is a legitimate URL, but the actual destination points to a malicious website. For example, the text might say `https://paypal.com/login`, but the underlying `href` attribute in the HTML points to a phishing domain like `http://paypal.secure-login.xyz`.
* **Analysis:** Link manipulation preys on the user's assumption that what they see is what they get. It's an effective way to camouflage a malicious destination. Encouraging users to **hover over links** before clicking is a primary defense against this tactic.

### ### Credential Harvesting

* **What it is:** This is often the ultimate goal of a phishing campaign. The malicious links in the email direct the victim to a fake login page that is a pixel-perfect clone of a legitimate site. When the user enters their username and password, the credentials are captured by the attacker.
* **Analysis:** Credential harvesting is a direct path to account takeover. Once attackers have valid credentials, they can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, conduct financial fraud, or use the compromised account to launch further attacks against the victim's contacts.

### ### HTML to Impersonate a Legitimate Brand

* **What it is:** Attackers use HTML and CSS to meticulously craft emails that look identical to official communications from a trusted brand. This includes using the company's logo, color scheme, font, and layout.
* **Analysis:** A professionally designed email significantly increases the lure's credibility. When an email looks and feels authentic, the user's suspicion is lowered, making them more susceptible to the other techniques being used, such as urgency and link manipulation.

### ### Malicious Attachments

* **What it is:** Instead of or in addition to a malicious link, the email may contain an attachment. Common malicious file types include `.html` (to open a local phishing page), `.zip` (to hide an executable), or macro-enabled Office documents (`.docm`, `.xlsm`).
* **Analysis:** Attachments can be a highly effective delivery mechanism for malware (like trojans or ransomware) or for directing a user to a phishing page without relying on a URL that might be flagged by a security filter. The user's curiosity or belief that the attachment is an important document (e.g., an invoice, shipping notice) is exploited.

### ### URL Shortening Services

* **What it is:** Attackers use services like `bit.ly` or `tinyurl.com` to mask the true destination of a URL. The shortened link appears generic and hides the suspicious-looking phishing domain.
* **Analysis:** This technique serves two purposes: it evades email filters that are programmed to block known malicious domains, and it prevents a security-conscious user from immediately identifying a suspicious link.

### ### Recipient is BCCed

* **What it is:** The recipient's email address is placed in the Blind Carbon Copy (BCC) field instead of the `To` or `CC` field. Legitimate companies typically address a customer directly in the `To` field.
* **Analysis:** This is a subtle but important red flag. It indicates that the same email has been sent to a large, hidden list of targets. It reveals the impersonal and mass-produced nature of the attack, contradicting the email's claim to be a personalized security or account notification.

### ### Pixel Tracking

* **What it is:** A tiny, transparent 1x1 pixel image is embedded in the email's HTML. When the recipient opens the email, their email client requests this image from the attacker's server.
* **Analysis:** This is a reconnaissance technique. The request signals to the attacker that the email address is active and the recipient opened the message. This information is valuable for confirming the validity of a target list and for understanding the effectiveness of a phishing campaign's subject line and delivery.

### ### Poor Grammar and/or Typos

* **What it is:** The email content contains spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or grammatical errors that would be uncommon in official corporate communications.
* **Analysis:** While often seen as a sign of an unsophisticated attacker, this can sometimes be a deliberate tactic. It acts as a filter, weeding out more discerning individuals. Those who overlook these errors are statistically more likely to fall for the entire phishing scheme. It can also be used to bypass spam filters that look for specific, well-written phrases from legitimate companies.

## Conclusion

Recognizing phishing emails is not about spotting a single red flag, but about understanding how attackers **combine multiple techniques** to build a convincing narrative. For a SOC Analyst or any cybersecurity professional, the ability to deconstruct these emails is a critical skill. Each technique, from the spoofed sender to the manipulated link, is a piece of a larger puzzle. By identifying these individual pieces, we can better protect our organizations, educate users, and respond effectively to incoming threats.
